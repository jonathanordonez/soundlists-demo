This is a demo of the website I am building called Soundlists.com.

The webiste uses React and Django:
> See the frontend folder for the React files.
> See the proj6_spotilists folder for the Django project files.
> See the spotilists folder for the Django app files. 

In this demo you are automatically logged in as user "Niko" who holds a free Spotify subscription.
Here are the actions that, as Niko, you can take:
> Change the profile picture.
> Publish a playlist to the feed. These playlists are read directly from Niko's Spotify account.
> Delete a playlist you've posted in the feed.
> Copy a playlist somebody else has added to the feed into Niko's Spotify.
> Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more posts.
